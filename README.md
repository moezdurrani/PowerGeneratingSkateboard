In a joint effort with three fellow students, we designed a 3D model of a skateboard that captures the energy from movement and turns it into electricity. This electricity is stored in a battery within the skateboard. Later, it can be used to give the skateboard an extra boost or even power other electronic devices. It was an exciting project that combined practical design with a bit of eco-friendly ingenuity, aiming to add a new, energy-conscious dimension to skateboarding.
